* genetics/: empirical data related to the parentage genetics

* 2017drifters.csv: Deployments in 2017 of Pacific Gyre Microstars from Visca, Bay Bay City, Philippines. Also see https://bco-dmo.org/dataset/862360
* 1704021_leyte_20170608_MA.csv: data from a Lowell Instruments TCM-1 Tilt Current Meter. Also see https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/862420
* README.md
* drifter2017.txt: Raw drifter data, unfiltered so contains data from when one drifter was still turned on during return flight back to NJ
* enso.csv" External data with the ENSO index over study time, used in a test analysis looking for ENSO index correlations with kernels
* meiv2.csv: External data with the ENSO index over study time, used in a test analysis looking for ENSO index correlations with kernels. See https://psl.noaa.gov/enso/mei/data/meiv2.data
* site_area_header_nonsurveyed_simulation_kernels.csv: Area (meters squared) of all the sites included in the model, included rows with values corresponding to 10% of the maximum area estimated for the nearby North and South locations, to test sensitivity of results to over estimating habitable reef area in these regions.
* site_area_header_nonsurveyed_simulation_kernels_test.csv: Area (meters squared) of all the sites included in the model, same as site_area_header_nonsurveyed_simulation_kernels.csv but grouping all Camotes Islands together and not listing individual values. 
* site_centroids_SimTest.csv: File containing the lat/lon centers of each site in model, used in the main notebook fit_data.ipynb/fit_data.R.
